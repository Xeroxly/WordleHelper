App created with React to assist in the solving of the popular game Wordle!
- Created by Trevor Sloan

Enter a guess, click each letter until it gets to the same state as shown in the game Wordle (gray, yellow, green)
This will educate the algorithim as to what a good guess might be.
When ready click "Show Guesses" for a list of potential options for your given game.

*Not necessary for all cases*
I would recommend getting at least one green letter, and/or 3+ yellow letters before showing guesses to avoid performance issues in generation.
